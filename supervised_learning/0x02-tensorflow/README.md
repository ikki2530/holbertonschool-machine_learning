## Description
Review of basic concepts about Tensorflow


## Learning Objectives
### General

- What is tensorflow?
- What is a session? graph?
- What are tensors?
- What are variables? constants? placeholders? How do you use them?
- What are operations? How do you use them?
- What are namespaces? How do you use them?
- How to train a neural network in tensorflow
- What is a checkpoint?
- How to save/load a model with tensorflow
- What is the graph collection?
- How to add and get variables from the collection


## Files Description

### Single neuron.

[0-create_placeholders.py](0-create_placeholders.py) - function that returns two placeholders, x and y, for the neural network.

[1-create_layer.py](1-create_layer.py) - Creates a new layer

[2-forward_prop.py](2-forward_prop.py) - Creates the forward propagation graph for the neural network.

[3-calculate_accuracy.py](3-calculate_accuracy.py) - Calculates the accuracy of a prediction

[4-calculate_loss.py](4-calculate_loss.py) - Calculates the softmax cross-entropy loss of a prediction.

[5-create_train_op.py](5-create_train_op.py) - Creates the training operation for the network

[6-train.py](6-train.py) - Builds, trains, and saves a neural network classifier

[7-evaluate.py](7-evaluate.py) - Evaluates the output of a neural network
