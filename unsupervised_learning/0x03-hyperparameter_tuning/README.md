## Files Description

[0-gp.py](0-gp.py) - represents a noiseless 1D Gaussian process.
[1-gp.py](1-gp.py) - predicts the mean and standard deviation of points in a Gaussian process.
[2-gp.py](2-gp.py) - updates a Gaussian Process.
[3-bayes_opt.py](3-bayes_opt.py) - performs Bayesian optimization on a noiseless 1D Gaussian process.
